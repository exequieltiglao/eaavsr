    <string name="appObjectives">The main objective of the speech recognition is to devise a computer program
        that distinguishes between speakers. It will translate to our system that will help people so easily
        contact their relatives when an incident comes by saying just a word. The application will get the device\'s
        current location that will allow the user to inform the selected contact when the user is in danger.
        In this case, speech recognition has alternative way to send messages
        automatically when the user can\'t able to open or use their phone in different situations.
